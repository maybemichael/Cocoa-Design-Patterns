#  Cocoa Design Patterns Project

1. Objective Challenge - Pair off, and with a peer, each choose a design pattern and think of an instance you’ve used it code you’ve written or have seen it used in UIKit.

2.  Objective Challenge - Look through the documentation and find at least one UIKit class that uses the singleton pattern.

3. Objective Challenge - Think about a time we’ve used the facade pattern before. Are there places that we could have used it to write better code but didn’t? Discuss with a peer.

4. Objective Challenge - Write code to post a notification when a button is tapped indicating a bell has rung. In another class, sign up to be notified when this notification is posted, and make sure it works.

5.  Objective Challenge - Add support for state restoration to another app you’ve built.
